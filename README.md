**CCSD: Score-based Diffusion model to generate Combinatorial Complexes using Stochastic Differential Equations.**

CCSD is a score-based diffusion model to generates combinatorial complexes. Generating objects with higher-order structures and relations could improve our ability to learn underlying distributions and thus generating more realistic complex objects.
