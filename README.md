**CCSD** is a sophisticated score-based diffusion model designed to generate Combinatorial Complexes using Stochastic Differential Equations. This cutting-edge approach enables the generation of complex objects with higher-order structures and relations, thereby enhancing our ability to learn underlying distributions and produce more realistic objects.

## Introduction

Complex object generation is a challenging problem with application in various fields such as drug discovery. The CCSD model offers a novel approach to tackle this problem by leveraging Diffusion Models and Stochastic Differential Equations to generate Combinatorial Complexes (CC). This topological structure generalizes the different mathematical stuctures used in Topological/Geometric Deep Learning to represent complex objects with higher-order structures and relations. The integration of the higher-order domain during the generation enhances the learning of the underlying distribution of the data and thus, allows for better data generation.

## Why CCSD?

CCSD stands out from traditional complex object generation models due to the following key advantages:

- *Combinatorial Complexes:* The model generates Combinatorial Complexes, enabling the synthesis of complex objects with rich structures and relationships.

- *Score-Based Diffusion:* CCSD utilizes score-based diffusion techniques, allowing for efficient, high-quality and state-of-the-art complex object generation.

- *Enhanced "Realism":* By incorporating higher-order structures, the generated objects are more representative of the underlying data distribution.
