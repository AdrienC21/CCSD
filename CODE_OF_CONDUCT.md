# Code of Conduct

We are a community based on openness, as well as friendly and didactic discussions.

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions.

Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests, answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are all priceless contributions.

You can also contribute to the field of topological deep learning in general by contributing the libraries such as TopoNetX, TopoEmbedX, TopoModelX, etc (see [Pyt-team](https://github.com/pyt-team)).

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of
